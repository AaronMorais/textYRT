=======

textYRT uses Twilio, Google's TransitFeed module, Flask and YRT GTFS data to provide realtime transit information.
Simply send a text to the number configured by your Twilio account with a YRT bus stop number.
Shortly after, you'll receive a response with the next five buses coming to you within a 24 hour period.
